really simple first lesson, talked about what a current actually is

also talked about basics of circuits:
eg:
 cell long line is posative short line negatie, remeber that a - is short 
 current flows from posative to negative but electrons themselfs flow negative to posative. 
 thats being caused by people assuming thing flow one way before mesuring them
 conventional current reffers to there posative to negative NOT THE FLOW OF ELECTRONS

we also did some practical, where we built a circuit with a bulb
we learnt how to use the multi meters
how to:
 put one input into the com (common port) and another goes into the coresponding wire you want to use
 10 amp (probably never used) is the far left
 mamps is the second from left
 common is third from left
 voltage is fouth
 turn the thing to where it is needed, a wavey line is ac, straight is dc
 if working with low volts/amps turn it down to mvolts or mamps

we also learnt more about the rest of the course
notable bits:
 we will start course work in second year
 first few weeks is just gonna be gcse recap
 then something about digital logic, sounds fun
 sheet about that in folder
 we will have done some of the second year stuff in year 1 to give us time for course work

we also joined the teams thing
