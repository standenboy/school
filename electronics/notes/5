mosfet's
(metal oxide semiconducting feild effect transistor)
voltage controled device
has a:
drain equivilant to the collector on a transistor
gate the base
source the emmiter

no current can flow into the gate

its just a new kind of transistor for the most part
differences between transistor:
	when it is on, it still conducts slightly (about 0.4V)
	this is because it has a slight resistance, whereas a transistor does not
	the small resistance it has is given the name Rdson (something about resistance when on (r d s on))
	there is a formula for this in the formula sheet

	a mosfet will start to conduct when the input voltage is 3V unless the question says otherwise

	when ploting a graph of a mosfet, with Vin and I at the drain (Id) the gradient of that line is called gm
	Id = gm * (Vin - 3)
	gm is called the transconductance

	the gm and rdson are propertys of the mosfet
