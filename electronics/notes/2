use these to convert to the standard unit 
ie:
 1km = 1 x 1000 meter
 1mV = 1 / 1000 volts 

G = giga = x 1,000,000,000 = x10^9
M = mega = x 1,000,000 = x10^6
k = kilo = x 1000 = x10^3
m = milli = / 1000 = x10^-3
u (funny u (mu)) = micro = / 1,000,000 = x10^-6
n = nano = / 1,000,000,000 = x10^-9
p = pico = / 1,000,000,000,000 = x10^-12

you can do the inverse of those to convert to a more reasonable scale
ie:
 120,000V = 12kV
 0.15A = 150mA

first half of the lesson was learning those and touching up on standard form

second half we are going over current and voltage

current is the rate of flow of charge, to find the current, i = q/t with i being current, q is culombs and t is time
AMETERS GO IN SERIS

voltage is the energy tranfered per unit of charge 
v = e/q with v being volts, e being energy, and q being culombs
VOLTMETER GO IN PARRALEL

later on we are doing practical, mesuring voltage with circuit with a bulb or a resistor
plotted the results on a graph, my resistor graph was perfectly liner
and my bulb graph is more similar to a cubic graph

kind of like that

we looked at a bit of resistance at the end, worksheet work (BRING IT TO THE NEXT LESSON)
