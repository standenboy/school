((1/r)+(1/r)+(1/r))^-1
that is the total resistance of the circuit if it is in parralel
we did this cool practical with a box to see where resistors are
when you have resistors in series the supply voltage is shared un evenly across the resistors
the sum of the voltages across the resistor will add up to the voltage from the power suply
if the resistors are of the same resistance the voltage will be an even split
greater voltage will go across the larger resistor
each component has the has an equal proportion of the total voltage compared to the proportion that the resistor is to the total voltage

(r1 / rt) = the proportion in restance

voltage across a componet = (r1 / rt) x VoltageTotal

kirchoff's first law, is that the current in all parralel branches adds up to the total current
his second law is that the sum of the energy in point equals the sum of potential differences around any loop of a circuit
