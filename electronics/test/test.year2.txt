3)b) The red LED will be on as the amp will be outputing 11V (see diagram for workings), which would mean that
over the green led and resistor is only 1V which wont be enough to light the LED, however over the red LED and 
resistor, is 11V which is enough to light the led

3)c)iii) R2 will recive a higher current than R1 as it has the higher resistance and it is in parralel with R1
meaning the current splits between them proportional to resistance

4)b)ii) a ripple counter will move upwards/downwards when the previce dtype has changed state, however a 
syncrhronos counter will count using a logic system from the clock and other outputs, (avoids propigation 
delay, and makes all outputs change at the same time whereas an asynchronos counter will change its outputs 
change at different times)
