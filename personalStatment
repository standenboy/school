Something that anyone who knows me can say, is my personal hobby and passion for computers
and  code, im always coming to my friends with my latest weekend project or the most random
tool thats older than me. Coding has really been a lifeline for me, starting around covid, I
had time to self teach, and thats what i did; most of the tools i now use are self taught, for
example my primary language being C, even though in school and collage ive only even been taught
python. Having learnt C really drew me to my next great passion which is micro controllers;
being aware of how low level langauges worked really made working on the constrained space
of a microcontroller feel more natural. Using these tools ive built everything from games,
to text editors, and even a custom keyboard/keypad, all of which were started by myself and
finshsed by myself.

After i learnt the basics of coding i looked projects as exaples for my own work, this drew
me to the open source software space, and since i began that seach, i have switched almost
all the software i use to open alternatives. doing this really pushed me to indisty standard
tools, like gnu/linux, command line tools like vim (which this docment was written with!),
and firefox. This switch really introduced me to all kinds of software, and that it isnt all
corprate, that independant projects, are not only used, but standard. I think having made this
switch did nothing but help me, giving me an earge to write more code, contribute to others,
and follow standards.

Throughout school ive always much prefered project work, starting with posters for history,
story writing for english and later with full scale programing and electronics work. I look
forward to doing this more at university where this kind of work is the default, as i find its
where i show my full abiliy to take a project from an idea to a finished product. My hobby has
also expanded into my education, most obviously in my course choices, however also in things
such as the club i started and run, (unix user group), where i teach the history of the unix
operating system, from my own self taught knowledge.  as an extention to my education, i found
work experience with a company called EWAVE for 1 week, where i worked with and tested micro
electronics, notably LED's, using my knowledge of electronics as a base and my knowledge of
code to assist the company in automating manual tesing.

Outside of my education i have a job working in a restraunt, which i have found to be stressful
however very rewarding, i enjoy the work i do in the kitchen, and i have made friends in my
colleges that will last for life. working in this team really pushes me to be active to not
let them down as we all manage small parts and all are important.
