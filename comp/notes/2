starting task 
1) 103
2) 10 10011011 
3) 10101001 x wrong numbers used
4) binary, denary, hexadecimal, octodecimal (base 8) x natural rational integer real

from gcse remember spliting a binary number every 4 bits and convert to hex

when you have signed bit it means - of the bit that is signed (usualy 128) + all the other values
your colums would be -128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
if you have less bits it might look like this -8, 4, 2, 1
same for if you have more bits

we did some fixed point binary, it goes like this, -128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25..
it is clear why we use floating point numbers

THE EXAM THINKS THAT 1G = 1000KB
THEY CALL 1024KB = 1 Gibibyte 

2^n is the maximum amount of values, n = the number of bits
