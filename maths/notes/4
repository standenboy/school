so far so good with maths, todays work was quite hard however

had to work on some completing the square

also found out how to solve some weird quadratics

if something is like x^6+x^3+2 its still a quadratic
to solve it you would say let y = x^3
then rewrite the equation as y^2+y+2
then solve with the quadratic formula or factorizing
and then cube root the ans to give it in terms of x for the final anwser

you can only do that when all the powers line up with something that can be divided to match a quadratic
so x + x^7 + 23 wouldnt work
