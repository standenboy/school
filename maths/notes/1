the fist lesson was not a nice time
started with setting up techy stuff, the classroom, outlook
then got straight in with a test

the test wasnt too bad but everyone else was alot faster, work on speed
cosine rule killed me as well as a large similtanius equation
work on them

need to chase up teacher on the text book login but have already sent an email so not too worried

the people next to you seem nice, although quiet as expected
