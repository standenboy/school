writing this late and cant really remember what we did
we did some work on completing the square which is never too hard, however i should try and do some more work on it
try and remember how to put something into a completed square form as well as take it out

x^2 + 6x + 6
(x + 3)^2 - 3
method is to half B, then subtract b^2, and add whatever is needed to make sure + c works

this can be used to find the turning point of the graph, the section in brackets needs to have its sign flipped
this is similar to using factorising to solve a quadratic
the value outside the bracket stays as is
in the example given the turning point would be (-3, -3)
