3rd maths lesson, going well so far, we are working on factorizing in the first half

i think we will be doing surds in the second half

the fatorizing is pretty easy overall

for factorizing things like 4x^2 + 4x + 3, you multiply the first value and the last then find a pair of numbers that adds together to equal the middle value, then put them back in individually and factorise the thing

surds does not sound fun

surds arent that bad really, to simplify them split them into 2 factors, one must be a square number
then square root the square number and move it out of the sign, then leave the remaining value

the lesson was fun, everyone was somewhat interested in the thinkpad, ill have to show them more next lesson
the guy oposite you knows what linux is

nothing was overly chalenging
