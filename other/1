notes on day 1

got the bs with rosile and jazmin 
when we got off the bus met jazmines friend, seemed a bit dull
got to collage then sat in libary with ben and rosile
pretty good, maths was not fun but i did it
see maths/notes/1 for more info
got out of maths and went to the libary, touched up on cosine rule, practice is in math/NEEDTOKNOW/cosineRule i think
that makes things feel alittle better
after that did alittle programing and fixed up the broken algorithum from the line game 
you should play it to get better
then had electronics, compared to maths alot better, the teacher seems nice enough, 
notes on lesson at electronics/notes/1
got out of collage and walked to the shops, missed the 15:50 will get the 16:50
currently writing these notes outside ee

todo things:
 chase up math teacher on the text book stuff
 learn friends names, there is alex, who is in tutor with you and then the other guy you keep meting, his names not ryan but simailar to ryan
 considering working on a project to make these notes easier to go back on 
 relized it will need ls dir in c so it will be something to work on and home then sshcp to laptop
